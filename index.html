			The <abbr title="Mt. San Antonio College">Mt. SAC</abbr> Cross Country Invitational, sees thousands of High Schoolers each year in which they compete across two days on a <b>grueling</b> 3 mile course. The course takes runners along three primary points of interest; switchbacks, Poop Out Hill, and Reservoir Hill. The dusty course is 3 miles and can frequently approach mid to high 90<sup>o</sup> weather.

			Although many greatly look forward to the Mt. SAC race each year, some coaches are opposed to <abbr title="Mt. San Antonio College">Mt. SAC</abbr> hosting the <abbr title="California Interscholastic Federation Southern Section">CIF SS</abbr> Championships.

			The start of the race (as seen above) is pretty hectic, but is essential given the sheer amount of races that need to be run throughout the day. However, there are many opportunities to pass others later on in the entire course.

			Nevertheless, The Mt. SAC Invitational is still one of my favorite courses, it is both challenging and rewarding seeing my time improve each year I go back. It's also one of the very few instances of a very large race, there are also spectators lined up <b>ALL</b> along the course to constantly cheer you on, because you'll definitely need it. One of the best parts of the whole experience is finishing your race and then running back out onto the course to cheer on your team mates as they complete the same insane course as you.
